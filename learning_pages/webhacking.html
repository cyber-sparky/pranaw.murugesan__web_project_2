            <!-- DESCIRIPTION FOR CLICKJACKING -->
            <h3>Have you experienced Clickjacking ?...</h1>
            <p>let's get into the course</p>
            <p>Clickjacking is an attack that tricks a user into clicking a webpage element which is invisible or
                disguised
                as another element. This can cause users to unwittingly download malware, visit malicious web pages,
                provide
                credentials or sensitive information, transfer money, or purchase products online. <b style="color:red">By clicking that button they can collect your IP ADDRESS</b></p>
                <p>A hacker can potentially use an IP address to attempt to gain unauthorized access to a network or device, launch a cyber attack, or gather sensitive information about the target.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the things a hacker might do with an IP address:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Port scanning: The hacker can use tools to scan the IP address for open ports and services that may be vulnerable to attack.</li>
                    <li>DDoS attacks: The hacker can launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack by flooding the target IP address with traffic, causing the network or device to become overwhelmed and unavailable.</li>
                    <li>Exploit vulnerabilities: The hacker can use the IP address to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the target's network or device.</li>
                    <li>Gather information: The hacker can use the IP address to gather information about the target's location, internet service provider (ISP), and other details that can be used for further attacks.</li>
                    <li>Spoofing: The hacker can spoof the IP address to launch attacks that appear to come from a different location, making it harder to trace the origin of the attack.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It's important to note that not all hackers have malicious intent and there are ethical hackers who use their skills to help organizations identify and fix security vulnerabilities. However, it's important to always protect your IP address and take necessary security precautions to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
