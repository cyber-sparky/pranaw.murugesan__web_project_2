            <!-- EXPLAINATION ABOUT SCRIPTING -->
            <p >In this Section, You will learn what is scripting and how it is works and how to write a script and execute it.</p>
            <p>First of all, what is scripting !?. In computer programming, a script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor (as a compiled program is).</p>
            <p>A script is sometimes used to mean a list of operating system commands
                that are prestored in a file and performed sequentially by the operating system's command interpreter
                whenever the list name is entered as a single command. <b>We are using python for scripting.</b></p>
                <h3>Python Scripting</h3>
            <p>You need to learn python to do scripting. If you already know python, Perfect!!. Otherwise learn the
                basic of python like (variables, loops, basic syntax, if conditions). I guess it's a basic thing, you
                already know this. Lets learn file handling before getting into scripting.</p>
            <h3 id="fileHandle">File Handling in Python</h3>
            <p>Make sure to install python in your computer, to check follow this command in your terminal</p>
            <div id="version" class="editor">
                <code>C:\Users\Scryptify> python --version</code>
            </div>
            <!-- EXPLAINING ABOUT FILE HANDLING -->
            <p>The file handling plays an important role when the data needs to be stored permanently into the file. A
                file is a named location on disk to store related information. We can access the stored information
                (non-volatile) after the program termination.</p>
            <p>The file-handling implementation is slightly lengthy or complicated in the other programming language,
                but it is easier and shorter in Python. </p>
            <p>In Python, files are treated in two modes as text or binary. The file may be in the text or binary
                format, and each line of a file is ended with the special character.</p>

            <p>Hence, a file operation can be done in the following order.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open a file</li>
                <li>Read or Write - Performing Operations</li>
                <li>Close the file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Python provides an <code>open()</code> function that accepts two arguments, file name and access mode in
                which the file is accessed. The function returns a file object which can be used to perform various
                operations like reading, writing, etc.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the simple example to open a file named "file.txt" (stored in the same directory) in read
                mode and printing its content on the console.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open you favourite code edit</li>
                <li>Create a python file with the extension of .py</li>
                <li>Try this below code</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- FIRST CODE TO WRITE -->
            <div class="editor">
                <code>#opens the file file.txt in read mode</code><br>
                <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code><br>
                <code>if testfile:</code><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <code>print("file is opened successfully")</code><br>
            </div>
            <!-- OUTPUT FOR THE CODE -->
            <p>The output will be :</p>
            <div id="output">
                <pre>&lt;class '_io.TextIOWrapper'&gt;</pre>
                <pre>file is opened successfully</pre>
            </div>
            <h3>Closing the file - close()</h3>
            <p>Once you open a file, you should save it and close it right. To close the file use <code>close()</code>.
            </p>
            <div class="editor">
                <code>#opens the file file.txt in read mode</code><br>
                <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code><br>
                <code>if testfile:</code><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <code>print("file is opened successfully")</code>
                <code>testfile.close()</code>
            </div>
            <p>In the second line we are writing <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code>. In the second argument of
                open is "r". What is "r" ?</p>
            <p>"r" means read. if we want to write the file, we have to specify "w". Here are the list of the commands
                you can use.</p>
                <!-- ACCESS MOD TABLE -->
            <table id="accessMode">

                            written file. It creates a new file if no file exists. The file pointer exists at the

            <p>So, Practice with this and try to write scripts on your own in your computer. Now for a practice we just
                write a script which will create a text file in Desktop who ever executing it.</p>
                <!-- code to create a file in desktop -->
            <div class="editor">
                <code>import os <br>
                f=open("C:/Users/"+os.getlogin()+"/Desktop/program.txt","w") <br>
                f.write("Successfully created a file which contains virus") <br>
                f.close()</code>
            </div>
            <!-- explaining what is os module -->
            <p>In the first line we imported OS module.</p>
            <p><strong>What is OS module ?</strong></p>
            <p>The OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc. You first need to import the os module to interact with the underlying operating system.</p>
            <p>In the second line we get the user name with os module method called getlogin() and writing some plain text in text file called program in desktop</p>
