                <h1 id="intro">Introduction to Scripting</h1>
                <p>In this Section, You will learn what is scripting and how it is works and how to write a script and execute
                    it.</p>
                <h3>What is Scripting</h2>
                    <p>First of all, what is scripting !?. In computer programming, a script is a program or sequence of
                        instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor
                        (as a compiled program is).</p>
                    <p>A script is sometimes used to mean a list of operating system commands
                        that are prestored in a file and performed sequentially by the operating system's command interpreter
                        whenever the list name is entered as a single command. <b>We are using python for scripting.</b></p>
        
                    <h3>Python Scripting</h3>
                    <p>You need to learn python to do scripting. If you already know python, Perfect!!. Otherwise learn the
                        basic of python like (variables, loops, basic syntax, if conditions). I guess it's a basic thing, you
                        already know this. Lets learn file handling before getting into scripting.</p>
                    <h3 id="fileHandle">File Handling in Python</h3>
                    <p>The file handling plays an important role when the data needs to be stored permanently into the file. A
                        file is a named location on disk to store related information. We can access the stored information
                        (non-volatile) after the program termination.</p>
                    <p>The file-handling implementation is slightly lengthy or complicated in the other programming language,
                        but it is easier and shorter in Python. </p>
                    <p>In Python, files are treated in two modes as text or binary. The file may be in the text or binary
                        format, and each line of a file is ended with the special character.</p>
                    
            <p>Hence, a file operation can be done in the following order.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open a file</li>
                <li>Read or Write - Performing Operations</li>
                <li>Close the file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Python provides an <code>open()</code> function that accepts two arguments, file name and access mode in
                which the file is accessed. The function returns a file object which can be used to perform various
                operations like reading, writing, etc.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the simple example to open a file named "file.txt" (stored in the same directory) in read
                mode and printing its content on the console.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open you favourite code edit</li>
                <li>Create a python file with the extension of .py</li>
                <li>Try this below code</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="editor">
                <code>#opens the file file.txt in read mode</code><br>
                <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code><br>
                <code>if testfile:</code><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <code>print("file is opened successfully")</code><br>
            </div>
            <p>The output will be :</p>
            <div id="output">
                <pre>&lt;class '_io.TextIOWrapper'&gt;</pre>
                <pre>file is opened successfully</pre>
            </div>
            <h3>Closing the file - close()</h3>
            <p>Once you open a file, you should save it and close it right. To close the file use <code>close()</code>.</p>
            <div class="editor">
                <code>#opens the file file.txt in read mode</code><br>
                <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code><br>
                <code>if testfile:</code><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <code>print("file is opened successfully")</code>
                <code>testfile.close()</code>
            </div>
            <p>In the second line we are writing <code>testfile = open("file.txt","r")</code>. In the second argument of open is "r". What is "r" ?</p>
            <p>"r" means read. if we want to write the file, we have to specify "w". Here are the list of the commands you can use.</p>
            <table id="accessMode">
                <tbody><tr>
                    <th>Access mode</th>

                    <td>r</td>

                    <td>w</td>
                    <td>It opens the file to write only. It overwrites the file if previously exists or creates a new one if no file exists with the same name. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.</td>

                    <td>w+</td>
                    <td>It opens the file to write and read both. It is different from r+ in the sense that it overwrites the previous file if one exists whereas r+ doesn't overwrite the previously written file. It creates a new file if no file exists. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.</td>

                    <td>It opens the file in the append mode. The file pointer exists at the end of the previously written file if exists any. It creates a new file if no file exists with the same name.</td>
