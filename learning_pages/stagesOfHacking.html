            <h3 id="hackingWork">What is hacking</h3>
            <p>Hacking refers to a process bypass or modifying the secuirty Mechanisms of computer software and hardware
                to accomplish a goal that differs from the origin pulpose. Those individuals who engage in hacking
                activiites are typically referred to as "Hackers and Crackers"</p>

                <!-- WHO IS HACKER -->
            <h3>Who is hacker</h3>
            <p>People thing that hacker are bad guys basically computer criminals but they fail to recognize the fact
                Hackers took technology at an extreme height, just because of some Black hat hacker(cracker) they think
                all hackers are criminals but in reality two different things</p>
            <p>A hacker is individual who had an advanced understanding of computers, networking, scripting,
                programming, or Embedding hardware, but did not have any malicious intents. Just opposite there are
                malicious hacker is usually referred to as a <b>Malicious Hacker, black hat, or criminal hacker,</b>
                which describes any individual who illegally breaks into network to damage or steal information.</p>

                <!-- TYPES OF HACKERS -->
            <h3>Type of Hackers</h3>
            <p><b>Black Hats Hackers:</b> A black hat Hacker is the just opposite of white hat hacker or you can say bad
                guy. It refers to a cracker that breaks into someone networks or computers. They are specialized in
                unauthorized penetration of information systems network for unauthorized penetration of information
                systems network for indivual purpose.</p>
            <p><b>White Hats Hackers:</b> A white hat Hacker is the information security professional or good guy,
                especially in Information Security, where it refers to an Ethical Hacker or Penetration Tester who
                focuses on securing and protecting networks and computers systems.</p>
            <p><b>Grey Hats Hackers:</b> A grey hat hacker refers to a skilled hacker who break into networks or
                computer but in order to bring the weakness to the attention or improve system and network security.</p>
            <p><b>Script Kiddies:</b> Script kiddies are like amateur kids who uses existing scripts or codes to hack
                into network and computer and software developed by real hackers.</p>
            <h3>What is vulnerability?</h3>
            <p>Vulnerability is a cyber-security term refers to a flaw existence of a weakness or implementation error
                that can lead to security vulnerabilities that hacker can take advantage of with exploits and compromise
                system.</p>

                <!-- WHAT IS EXPLOIT -->
            <h3>What is Exploit?</h3>
            <p>Exploit is an attack on a system, design to takes advantage of a particular vulnerabity that the system
                code offers to hacker gain access to system and compromise system</p>
            <h3 id="vul_ex">Vulnerability + Exploits = Access to system</h3>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAVE A SOME WEAKNESS LIKE ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. THIS IS A VULNERABITY, IF
                ANYONE WANT TO DAMAGE OR KILL THAT PERSON HE CAN MIX SOMETHING ON THEIR ALCOHOL LIKE POISON. POISON
                GOING TO EXPLOIT THEIR WEAKNESS AND KILL THEM</p>

                <!-- HACKING PHASES -->
            <h3>Hacking Phases</h3>
            <strong>As there are steps to every hackers do follow some predefined rules or steps to hack into the
                system.</strong>
            <h3 id="phase">1. Information Gathering:</h3>
            <p>Information gathering refers to preparatory phase where in security asssessment is focused on collecting
                as much information as possible about a target an attacker looks for gathering information about target
                to launching an attack</p>
            <strong>There are two type of Information gathering</strong>
            <strong>Passive information gathering involves gathering information without directly interacting with the
                target</strong>
            <p>For Example: searching on news or Google group</p>
            <strong>Active Information gathering involves interacting with the traget directly by any means.</strong>
            <p>For example: Facebook Chat or call</p>
            <h3>2. Scanning:</h3>
            <p>Scanning refers to the second phase when the attacker scans the network for specific information on
                network and attacker extract information such as like machines port, OS details, service etc. to launch
                attack</p>
            <h3>3. Gaining Access:</h3>
            <p>Gaining access the point where the attacker access to system or network. The attacker can escalate
                privilege to obtain complete control of system in the process, intermediate system that are connected to
                it are also compromised.</p>
            <h3>4. Maintaing Access:</h3>
            <p>Once a hacker has gained access, by hacking the system they want to keep that access for future
                exploitation and attacks. They use backdoors, rootkits, or Trojans for future access to compromise
                system.</p>
            <h3>5. Clearing Tracks:</h3>
            <p>Once hackers have been able to gain and maintain access, they always try to cover their tracks to avoid
                detection by computer forensic expert. Hackers try to remove all traces of the attack, such as log files
                or intrusion detection system alarms.</p>

            <!-- TELLING WHAT IS IP ADDRESS -->
            <h3 id="ipAddress">What is IP Address</h3>
            <p>An IP address is like a special number that helps your computer or phone know how to talk to other
                computers or phones on the internet. Just like how you have a name that helps your friends and
                family know who you are, every computer or phone connected to the internet has a unique IP address
                that helps it communicate with other devices.</p>
            <strong id="ip">Eg: <code>192.158.1.38</code></strong>
            <p>I'll explain a bit more!</p>
            <p>An IP address is made up of a series of numbers separated by dots, like 123.45.67.89. This number is
                assigned to your device by your internet service provider (ISP), and it allows your device to send and
                receive information over the internet.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a phone number for your device. Just like you can call someone by dialing their phone
                number, your device can communicate with other devices on the internet by using their IP address.</p>
            <p>Here are some things you can do with an IP address:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Browse the web: When you type a website address into your browser, your device uses the website's IP
                    address to connect to it and display the webpage.</li>
                <li>Send and receive emails: Your email service uses your IP address to send and receive emails.</li>
                <li>Play online games: Online games use IP addresses to connect players from different locations and
                    enable them to play games together</li>
                <li>Make video calls: Video conferencing applications use IP addresses to connect users and enable them
                    to communicate through video calls.</li>
                <li>Download and upload files: File sharing applications use IP addresses to connect users and enable
                    them to download and upload files.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, an IP address is a crucial component of internet connectivity and enables us to perform a
                variety of online activities.</p>

            <!-- WHAT ISP -->
            <h3 id="isp">What is an ISP</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/isp.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is like a mailman for the internet. Just like how a mailman
                delivers letters and packages to your home, an ISP delivers internet to your computer or device so you
                can browse the web, watch videos, or play games online. It's the company that connects you to the
                internet and helps you stay connected.</p>
            <p>for example:</p>
            <p>Let's say you have a special box called a computer that can do lots of fun things. But your computer
                needs something called the internet to work properly. An ISP is like the magical delivery person who
                brings the internet to your computer, just like how a mailman delivers letters to your home. They make
                sure you can visit websites, watch videos, and play games online. Without them, your computer wouldn't
                be able to do all the cool things it can do.</p>
            <p>There are many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around India.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Airtel</li>
                <li>Jio</li>
                <li>Vi</li>
                <li>BSNL</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is Internet</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/internet.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The internet is like a really big playground with lots of fun things to see and do. It's a special place
                where computers and devices can talk to each other and share information. Just like how you can talk to
                your friends and family, the internet lets people all over the world talk to each other, play games,
                watch videos, and find answers to their questions. It's a place full of pictures, stories, and all kinds
                of interesting things to explore.</p>
            <p>for example:</p>
            <p>Imagine the internet as a giant library that has books, pictures, and videos from all around the world.
                Just like how you can go to a library and find books about animals, fairy tales, or space, the internet
                has all those things and more! You can use a special device, like a tablet or a computer, to visit the
                internet library and find all sorts of fun and educational things. You can look at pictures of cute
                animals, watch your favorite cartoons, or even learn new things by reading stories and watching videos.
                The internet is like a magical library that never closes, and you can always find something exciting to
                discover.</p>
