            <h3 id="ipAddress">What is IP Address</h3>
            <p>An IP address is like a special number that helps your computer or phone know how to talk to other
                computers or phones on the internet. Just like how you have a name that helps your friends and
                family know who you are, every computer or phone connected to the internet has a unique IP address
                that helps it communicate with other devices.</p>
            <strong id="ip">Eg: <code>192.158.1.38</code></strong>
            <p>I'll explain a bit more!</p>
            <p>An IP address is made up of a series of numbers separated by dots, like 123.45.67.89. This number is
                assigned to your device by your internet service provider (ISP), and it allows your device to send and
                receive information over the internet.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a phone number for your device. Just like you can call someone by dialing their phone
                number, your device can communicate with other devices on the internet by using their IP address.</p>
            <p>Here are some things you can do with an IP address:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Browse the web: When you type a website address into your browser, your device uses the website's IP
                    address to connect to it and display the webpage.</li>
                <li>Send and receive emails: Your email service uses your IP address to send and receive emails.</li>
                <li>Play online games: Online games use IP addresses to connect players from different locations and
                    enable them to play games together</li>
                <li>Make video calls: Video conferencing applications use IP addresses to connect users and enable them
                    to communicate through video calls.</li>
                <li>Download and upload files: File sharing applications use IP addresses to connect users and enable
                    them to download and upload files.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, an IP address is a crucial component of internet connectivity and enables us to perform a
                variety of online activities.</p>

            <h3 id="isp">What is an ISP</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/isp.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is like a mailman for the internet. Just like how a mailman
                delivers letters and packages to your home, an ISP delivers internet to your computer or device so you
                can browse the web, watch videos, or play games online. It's the company that connects you to the
                internet and helps you stay connected.</p>
            <p>for example:</p>
            <p>Let's say you have a special box called a computer that can do lots of fun things. But your computer
                needs something called the internet to work properly. An ISP is like the magical delivery person who
                brings the internet to your computer, just like how a mailman delivers letters to your home. They make
                sure you can visit websites, watch videos, and play games online. Without them, your computer wouldn't
                be able to do all the cool things it can do.</p>
            <p>There are many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) around India.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Airtel</li>
                <li>Jio</li>
                <li>Vi</li>
                <li>BSNL</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is Internet</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/internet.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The internet is like a really big playground with lots of fun things to see and do. It's a special place
                where computers and devices can talk to each other and share information. Just like how you can talk to
                your friends and family, the internet lets people all over the world talk to each other, play games,
                watch videos, and find answers to their questions. It's a place full of pictures, stories, and all kinds
                of interesting things to explore.</p>
                <p>for example:</p>
                <p>Imagine the internet as a giant library that has books, pictures, and videos from all around the world. Just like how you can go to a library and find books about animals, fairy tales, or space, the internet has all those things and more! You can use a special device, like a tablet or a computer, to visit the internet library and find all sorts of fun and educational things. You can look at pictures of cute animals, watch your favorite cartoons, or even learn new things by reading stories and watching videos. The internet is like a magical library that never closes, and you can always find something exciting to discover.</p>
            <h3>Who is a hacker</h3>
            <p>A hacker is ideally a person who is skilled in information technology. He uses his technical knowledge to
                overcome an obstacle or sometimes even achieve a goal within a computerized system. However, in recent
                times, the term hacker is always associated with a security hacker someone who is always on the lookout
                for ways to acquire and exploit sensitive personal, financial and organizational information, which is
                otherwise not accessible to them. Legitimate figures often use hacking for legal purposes.</p>
            <h3 id="hackingWork">How does Hacking Work?</h3>
            <p>Hackers are highly skilled in breaching securities to gain unauthorized access to phones, tablets,
                computers, IoT devices, networks, or the networking system of an entire organization. They are generally
                very proficient in exploiting weaknesses in network security, taking advantage of the same. These
                weaknesses can be technical or social in nature.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical weaknesses: Hackers are extremely talented in exploiting software vulnerabilities or weak
                    security practices. They do this to gain unauthorized access or even sometimes to inject malware
                    that would crumple the entire system.</li>
                <li>Social weaknesses: This kind of social engineering is done to convince those with privileged access
                    to click on malicious links, open infected files, or reveal personal information. This allows them
                    access to otherwise hardened infrastructures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Computers and the Internet have changed the work environment of the world beyond imagination. Computers
                on taking over a major part of our lives, all our data has got transferred from records and ledgers to
                computers. Though this kind of shift in working has reduced the physical burden on workers it has also
                increased the chances of data theft. People involved in stealing data or harming the systems are
                knowledgeable people with wrong intentions known as Hackers. There are different types of hackers. Letâ€™s
                take a look at how many types of hackers are there and the types of hacker attacks and techniques.</p>
            <h3 id="white">Who is White Hat</h3>
            <p>A white hat hacker or ethical hacker is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security
                vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers or malicious
                hackers white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are
                former black hat hackers. The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and
                the bad guys wore black hats. White hat hackers only seek vulnerabilities or exploits when they are
                legally permitted to do so. White hat hackers may do their research on open source software, as well as
                on software or systems they own or have been authorized to investigate, including products and services
                that operate bug bounty programs.</p>
            <h3 id="gray">Who is a Gray Hat</h3>
            <p>Somewhere between white and black are gray hat hackers. Gray hat hackers enact a blend of both black hat
                and white hat activities. Gray hat hackers often look for vulnerabilities in a system without the
                owner's permission or knowledge. If issues are found, they report them to the owner, sometimes
                requesting a small fee to fix the problem. Some gray hat hackers like to believe they are doing
                something good for companies by hacking their websites and invading their networks without permission.
                Still, company owners rarely appreciate unauthorized forays into their business information
                infrastructure. Often, a gray hat's real intention is to show off their skills and gain publicity â€”
                maybe even appreciation â€” for what they consider a contribution to cybersecurity.</p>
            <h3 id="black">Who is a Black Hat</h3>
            <p>Black hat hackers often develop specialties, such as phishing or managing remote access tools. Many get
                their "jobs" through forums and other connections on the dark web. Some develop and sell malicious
                software themselves, but others prefer to work through franchises or leasing arrangements â€“ again,
                similar to the legitimate business world.Hacking has become an integral intelligence-gathering tool for
                governments, but it is more common for black hat hackers to work alone or with organized crime
                organizations for easy money.</p>
            <h3 id="stages">Stages of Hacking</h3>
            <h4>Reconnaissance</h4>
            <p>This is the first step of Hacking. It is also called as Footprinting and information gathering Phase.
                This is the preparatory phase where we collect as much information as possible about the target.</p>
            <p>We usually collect information about three groups,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network</li>
                <li>Host</li>
                <li>People involved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are two types of Footprinting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Active: Directly interacting with the target to gather information about the target. Eg Using Nmap
                    tool to scan the target</li>
                <li>Passive: Trying to collect the information about the target without directly accessing the target.
                    This involves collecting information from social media, public websites etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Scanning</h4>
            <p>Here, Three types of scanning are involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Port Scanning This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live
                    systems, various services running on the host.</li>
                <li>Vulnerability Scanning: Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be
                    exploited. Usually done with help of automated tools</li>
                <li>Network Mapping: Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host
                    information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a
                    valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Gaining Access</h4>
            <p>This phase is where an attacker breaks into the system/network using various tools or methods. After
                entering into a system, he has to increase his privilege to administrator level so he can install an
                application he needs or modify data or hide data.</p>
            <h4>Maintaining Access</h4>
            <p>Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to
                maintain or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done
                using Trojans, Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain the access to the target until
                he finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish in that target.</p>
            <h4>Clearing Tracks</h4>
            <p>No thief wants to get caught. An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point
                of time, no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the
                values of Logs, modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all
                folders he created.</p>

                    <p>It's important to note that not all hackers are criminals, and some individuals who engage in
                        hacking activities may do so for ethical reasons. However, unauthorized access to computer
                        systems or networks is generally illegal and can result in serious consequences. Organizations
                        and individuals should take steps to protect their systems and networks from unauthorized
                        access, including implementing security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and
                        strong passwords.</p>
